# **Dream Job** 


- Finding a job is hard, sifting through countless applications on a multitude of Job sites doesn’t make it any easier. That's where the Dream Job app comes in. In order to utilize the Dream Job app we do ask that you log in via your LinkedIn account, as prompted at the bottom of the home page.

 - Once authenticated, navigate to the My Jobs page to easily keep track of all of your applications.  Update each application with useful information, such as desired Role, Job   location, date tracking, and the current status of your application while on the hunt, all stored securely in a database for the next time you log in.

- With the growing number of platforms for Job/Career networking, it can become a nightmare trying to keep track of  contacts and colleagues.  Not anymore, with Dream Jobs uber-helpful contact page!  A one stop form for all the contact information you would need about work colleagues, potential business partners, or future employers. Simply navigate to the contacts page, add a new contact, complete with company/role, email, phone number, as well as your business relationship with said contact.  After adding the contact and refreshing the page, you will see the newest addition to your contact list, also stored securely in a database.
